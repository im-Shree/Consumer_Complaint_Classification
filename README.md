## Consumer_Complaint_Classification
  
  This project aims to classify consumer complaints based on their text descriptions using machine learning. The project is developed in Python and    utilizes several libraries including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

### The project is structured as follows:

  data/Consumer_Complaints.csv: 
    
    Contains the data used for training and testing the model
  
  Consumer Complaint Classification.ipynb: 
    
    Contains the trained machine learning models
    Contains the source code for the project
    Contains functions for data preprocessing
    Contains functions for training and testing the machine learning model
    The main script that runs the entire project

### Libraries

     pandas
     numpy
     matplotlib.pyplot
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,cross_val_score
     Pipeline 
     sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB, 
     sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier, and 
     CatBoostClassifier.

   These are all machine learning tools available in Python's Scikit-learn and CatBoost libraries that can be used to classify consumer complaints based on their text descriptions.
  
### Pipeline
   
     The Pipeline class in Scikit-learn is a tool for simplifying the process of building machine learning models by chaining together several steps into a single object. A typical Pipeline consists of a sequence of data transformations and an estimator that will be trained on the transformed data. Using a Pipeline allows you to train and test your model more easily, as well as to optimize hyperparameters for the entire model at once.

### BernoulliNB
 
   BernoulliNB is a naive Bayes classifier that is specifically designed for binary (two-class) classification problems. It assumes that the features are independent of each other, and that each feature has a Bernoulli distribution. In other words, each feature is either present or absent, and the likelihood of a feature being present is determined by the proportion of training instances in which it is present.

### DecisionTreeClassifier
 
   DecisionTreeClassifier is a decision tree-based classifier that uses a tree structure to model the decisions that lead to the desired classification. The decision tree is constructed by recursively splitting the data into smaller subsets based on the value of a feature, until the subsets are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable.

### CatBoostClassifier
  
    CatBoostClassifier is a gradient boosting algorithm that is designed to work with categorical features. It is built on top of the CatBoost library, which is a machine learning library developed by Yandex. CatBoostClassifier is able to handle missing values and has built-in support for parallel processing, which makes it very efficient for large datasets.
    
### StackingClassifier   
  
    StackingClassifier is a type of ensemble learning method available in Python's Scikit-learn library that combines multiple classifiers to improve the overall predictive performance. In a stacking ensemble, the predictions of multiple base classifiers are combined using a meta-classifier that learns to weigh the outputs of the base classifiers.


### Copy code
  
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/consumer-complaint-classification.git

    This will preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and test the model on a holdout dataset. 
    The resulting accuracy of the model will be printed to the console.
